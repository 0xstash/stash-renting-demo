## Getting Started

First, you need to set your API key as an environment variable. To do that, create a file named **.env** in the project folder and paste the following value by replacing *api_key* with your own API key:

```
DEFAULT_API_KEY=api_key
```

After that run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
